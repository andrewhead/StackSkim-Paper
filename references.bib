	abstract = {Algorithm visualization ({AV}) technology graphically illustrates how algorithms work. Despite the intuitive appeal of the technology, it has failed to catch on in mainstream computer science education. Some have attributed this failure to the mixed results of experimental studies designed to substantiate {AV} technology's educational effectiveness. However, while several integrative reviews of {AV} technology have appeared, none has focused specifically on the software's effectiveness by analyzing this body of experimental studies as a whole. In order to better understand the effectiveness of {AV} technology, we present a systematic meta-study of 24 experimental studies. We pursue two separate analyses: an analysis ofindependent variables , in which we tie each study to a particular guiding learning theory in an attempt to determine which guiding theory has had the most predictive success; and an analysis of dependent variables, which enables us to determine which measurement techniques have been most sensitive to the learning benefits of {AV} technology. Our most significant finding is that how students use {AV} technology has a greater impact on effectiveness than what {AV} technology shows them. Based on our findings, we formulate an agenda for future research into {AV} effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Programmers regularly use search as part of the development process, attempting to identify an appropriate {API} for a problem, seeking more information about an {API}, and seeking samples that show how to use an {API}. However, neither general-purpose search engines nor existing code search engines currently fit their needs, in large part because the information programmers need is distributed across many pages. We present Assieme, a Web search interface that effectively supports common programming search tasks by combining information from Web-accessible Java Archive ({JAR}) files, {API} documentation, and pages that include explanatory text and sample code. Assieme uses a novel approach to finding and resolving implicit references to Java packages, types, and members within sample code on the Web. In a study of programmers performing searches related to common programming tasks, we show that programmers obtain better solutions, using fewer queries, in the same amount of time spent using a general Web search interface.},

We propose a novel user interface that is based on collections of lightweight editable fragments, called bubbles, which when grouped together form concurrently visible working sets. In this paper we describe the design of a prototype {IDE} user interface for Java based on working sets. A quantitative evaluation shows that developers could expect to view a sizeable number of functions concurrently with relatively few {UI} operations. A qualitative user evaluation with 23 professional developers indicates a high level of excitement, interest, and potential benefits and uses.},

As a result users must differentiate between workflows to choose the most suitable one for their task. We present Delta, an interactive workflow visualization and comparison tool that helps users identify the tradeoffs between workflows. We conducted an initial study to identify the set of attributes users attend to when comparing workflows, finding that they consider result quality, their knowledge of commands, and the efficiency of the workflow. We then designed Delta to surface these attributes at three granularities: a high-level, clustered view; an intermediate-level list view that contains workflow summaries; and a low-level detail view that allows users to compare two individual workflows. Finally, we conducted an evaluation of Delta on a small corpus of 30 workflows and found that the intermediate list view provided the best information density. We conclude with thoughts on how such a workflow comparison system could be scaled up to larger corpora in the future.},

	abstract = {Large clusters of mutual dependence have long been regarded as a problem impeding comprehension, testing, maintenance, and reverse engineering. An effective visualization can aid an engineer in addressing the presence of large clusters. Such a visualization is presented. It allows a program's dependence clusters to be considered from an abstract high level down thru a concrete source-level. At the highest level of abstraction, the visualization uses a heat-map (a color scheme) to efficiently overview the clusters found in an entire system. Other levels include three source code views that allow a user to "zoom" in on the clusters starting from the high-level system view, down through a file view, and then onto the actual source code where each cluster can be studied in detail. Also presented are two case studies, the first is the open-source calculator bc and the second is the industrial program copia, which performs signal processing. The studies consider qualitative evaluations of the visualization. From the results, it is seen that the visualization reveals high-level structure of programs and interactions between its components. The results also show that the visualization highlights potential candidates (functions/files) for re-factoring in bc and finds dependence pollution in copia.},

	abstract = {Question answering (Q\&A) websites are now large repositories of valuable knowledge. While most Q\&A sites were initially aimed at providing useful answers to the question asker, there has been a marked shift towards question answering as a community-driven knowledge creation process whose end product can be of enduring value to a broad audience. As part of this shift, specific expertise and deep knowledge of the subject at hand have become increasingly important, and many Q\&A sites employ voting and reputation mechanisms as centerpieces of their design to help users identify the trustworthiness and accuracy of the content. To better understand this shift in focus from one-off answers to a group knowledge-creation process, we consider a question together with its entire set of corresponding answers as our fundamental unit of analysis, in contrast with the focus on individual question-answer pairs that characterized previous work. Our investigation considers the dynamics of the community activity that shapes the set of answers, both how answers and voters arrive over time and how this influences the eventual outcome. For example, we observe significant assortativity in the reputations of co-answerers, relationships between reputation and answer speed, and that the probability of an answer being chosen as the best one strongly depends on temporal characteristics of answer arrivals. We then show that our understanding of such properties is naturally applicable to predicting several important quantities, including the long-term value of the question and its answers, as well as whether a question requires a better answer. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the design of Q\&A sites.},

An exploration set of tasks was also included to examine the effectiveness of and user satisfaction with the {RB}++ when applied to a large federal statistics website. The comparison study strongly supported that {RB}++ was more effective, efficient, and satisfying for completing data exploration tasks. Based on the results, efforts to automatically populate the underlying database using machine learning techniques are underway. Preliminary implementations for two large-scale federal statistical websites have been installed on government servers for internal evaluation.},

	abstract = {Understanding the data structures in a program is crucial to understanding how the program works, or why it doesn't work. Inspecting the code that implements the data structures, however, is an arduous task and often fails to yield insights into the global organization of a program's data. Inspecting the actual contents of the heap solves these problems but presents a significant challenge of its own: finding an effective way to present the enormous number of objects it contains. In this paper we present Heapviz, a tool for visualizing and exploring snapshots of the heap obtained from a running Java program. Unlike existing tools, such as traditional debuggers, Heapviz presents a global view of the program state as a graph, together with powerful interactive capabilities for navigating it. Our tool employs several key techniques that help manage the scale of the data. First, we reduce the size and complexity of the graph by using algorithms inspired by static shape analysis to aggregate the nodes that make up a data structure. Second, we introduce a dominator-based layout scheme that emphasizes hierarchical containment and ownership relations. Finally, the interactive interface allows the user to expand and contract regions of the heap to modulate data structure detail, inspect individual objects and field values, and search for objects based on type or connectivity. By applying Heapviz to both constructed and real-world examples, we show that Heapviz provides programmers with a powerful and intuitive tool for exploring program behavior.},

Yet How-To content - including text, images, animations, and videos - is available online for a wide variety of crafts. We interviewed people engaged in various crafts to investigate how online resources contributed to their craft practice. We found that participants sought creative inspiration as well as technical clarification online. In this domain, keyword search can be difficult, so supplemental strategies are used. Participants sought information iteratively, because they often needed to enact their knowledge in order to evaluate it. Our description of people learning how allows us to elaborate existing understandings of information-seeking behavior by considering how search originates and is evaluated in knowledge domains involving physical objects and physical processes.},

Mica works by using the Google Web {APIs} to find relevant pages, and then analyzing the content of those pages to extract the most relevant programming terms and to classify the type of each result},

I propose a preliminary method for designing visually searchable maps based on experimental results about what kinds of visual search are easy. The hope is that the resulting maps will better employ the perceptual capabilities of their viewers when they search. An example information map of recent movies illustrates the approach},

The truly worldwide reach of the Web has brought with it a new realization among computer scientists and laypeople of the enormous importance of usability and user interface design. In the last ten years, much has become understood about what works in search interfaces from a usability perspective, and what does not. Researchers and practitioners have developed a wide range of innovative interface ideas, but only the most broadly acceptable make their way into major web search engines. This book summarizes these developments, presenting the state of the art of search interface design, both in academic research and in deployment in commercial systems. Many books describe the algorithms behind search engines and information retrieval systems, but the unique focus of this book is specifically on the user interface. It will be welcomed by industry professionals who design systems that use search interfaces as well as graduate students and academic researchers who investigate information systems.},

The research literature suggests that users want to lay out search results spatially in overlapping "piles," but a pilot study with a flexible canvas tool revealed that this design requires too much manipulation and has other drawbacks. This finding led to a novel hybrid design that combines structure with a flexible visual layout and which allows the analysts to quickly triage documents first and organize them later, or interweave these two processes. Two usability studies comparing the new design against a legacy tool found overwhelming preference for the new tool for saving and organizing search results. Design guidelines derived from this work could improve sensemaking interfaces for other search applications.},

In these systems a relatively small subset of users is responsible for the majority of the contributions, and ultimately, for the success of the Q/A system itself. However, due to built-in incentivization mechanisms, standard expert identification methods often misclassify very active users for knowledgable ones, and misjudge activeness for expertise. This paper contributes a novel metric for expert identification, which provides a better characterisation of users‚Äô expertise by focusing on the quality of their contributions. We identify two classes of relevant users, namely sparrows and owls, and we describe several behavioural properties in the context of the {StackOverflow} Q/A system. Our results contribute new insights to the study of expert behaviour in Q/A platforms, that are relevant to a variety of contexts and applications.},

Our contribution is a novel combination of visualizations and pattern extraction techniques, enabling user exploration, analysis and understanding of traces containing millions of events. Three complimentary views help the user answer different questions. First, the Event Flow view shows the trace in its entirety or in detail. The user sees visual patterns representing phases of processing and the relative order of events. Second, the Event Statistics view quantifies events, and presents distributions and averages enabling the user to identify outlier behavior. Third, the Sequence Context view extracts patterns of interest from the trace and represents them along with frequency and performance data in succinct execution flow diagrams. The user can navigate from patterns to their constituent instance sequences and even back to individual events in the other views. Questions can be answered and hypotheses tested using the most natural view for the task.},

Sifter first applies supervised machine learning to identify the commands contained in a collection of 2500 Photoshop tutorials obtained from the Web. It then provides three different views of the tutorial collection based on the extracted command-level structure: (1) A Faceted Browser View allows users to organize, sort and filter the collection based on tutorial category, command names or on frequently used command subsequences, (2) a Tutorial View summarizes and indexes tutorials by the commands they contain, and (3) an Alignment View visualizes the command-level similarities and differences between a subset of tutorials. An informal evaluation (n=9) suggests that Sifter enables users to successfully perform a variety of browsing and analysis tasks that are difficult to complete with standard keyword search. We conclude with a meta-analysis of our Photoshop tutorial collection and present several implications for the design of image manipulation software.}
