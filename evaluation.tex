\section{Evaluation}

We perform two evaluations.
The first informal study examines the user experience of developing one-off \glspl{name}, general-purpose \glspl{name}, and several interactions for accessing additional information through \glspl{name} as a tutorial reader.
The second, formal in-lab study verifies several hypotheses, including:
\noindent
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{H\arabic*.}, ref=H\arabic*, leftmargin=*]
\item Users reference fewer documents when using tutorials augmented with \glspl{name}
\item Users who encounter common programming or setup errors overcome them more quickly with \glspl{name}-augmented tutorials.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}
