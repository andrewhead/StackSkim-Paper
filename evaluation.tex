\section{Evaluation}

We conduct a 12-subject within-subjects study to demonstrate that \gls{name}-generated explanations of code can be helpful for understanding code snippets and transferring this understanding to new coding tasks.
In a screening survey, we verify that subjects may have some experience programming, but no past past exposure to CSS selectors or wget on the command line.

Subjects performed 4 tasks of adapting existing code found in StackOverflow snippets to an alternate but very related purpose.
For example, we have users determine how to scrape a web page for JPEG, given a code snippet that scrapes the web for PDFs.
We provide 2 tasks using wget and CSS selectors each, with one task for each task type accompanied by a \gls{name}-generated explanation that describes the code snippet.
Participants are \emph{not} allowed to access additional web resources beyond the current web page.
For each task, we measure whether users complete the task and the time to completion. 

We show that there is a statistically significant rate of increase in completion rate for code modification tasks accompanied by \gls{name}-generated explanations.
This affirms the value of \gls{name} as in-situ explanations of code.
Future studies can determine the frequency that novice and end-user programmers seek addi
