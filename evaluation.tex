\section{Evaluation}

We perform two evaluations.
The first informal study examines the user experience of developing one-off \glspl{name}, general-purpose \glspl{name}, and interactions for accessing additional information through \glspl{name} as a tutorial reader.
The second, formal in-lab study verifies hypotheses including:
\noindent
\begin{enumerate}%[label=\textbf{H\arabic*.}, ref=H\arabic*, leftmargin=*]
\item Users find \glspl{name} generate helpful, relevant explanations.
\item Users without familiarity with the grammars described by \glspl{name} gain better conceptual understanding.
\end{enumerate}
