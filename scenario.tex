\subsection{Writing a CSS \gls{name}}

A W3C developer uses a CSS parser from collaboration with a browser.
He finds a sampling of CSS selectors used on tutorials by scraping the web.
Then he develops a tree walker that produces descriptions of these selectors.
He boots up a server that runs this code.
The web API for the machine takes blocks of code, extracts selectors, and returns descriptions with index positions of the selectors in the text.

\subsection{Using a \gls{name}}

A programming learner is confused when in a tutorial.
She sees syntax that she doesn't recognize.
While she skims over it at first, she's scraping a different document than the tutorial is using, and realizes that hers is not finding any content.
She highlights the text of a line that she doesn't fully understand.
It tells her the line uses CSS and there is no reason to worry.
This selectors chooses links from containers of class `klazz'.
She now knows that she should modify her CSS selectors to get her scraper to work.
