\section{Preliminary Study}

\andrew{Do the following studies. Numbers included below are optimistic placeholders.}
\andrew{A table would be great to summarize these results.}

StackOverflow is a popular online Q\&A site for programmers to ask and answer progrmaming problems, with more than 16 million answers to more than 9 million questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item Through an inspection of the top 200 most-viewed posts on StackOverflow, we find 10 \emph{micro-languages} that are not included as tags of the post, but that are used incidentally, including command lines, SQL, and regular expressions. \marti{unclear wording; also, do you want to mention wget explicitly here as a pointer forward?}
\item In addition, out of 100 top-rated posts related to Python that include regular expressions, we found that 50\% did not include any description of what the regular expression was doing, and 75\% provided a concise description or less.\marti{do we want a bullet for command lines?}
(We can do the same for CSS in jQuery selections.)
\end{itemize}

For users who find code with unexplained languages and syntax, we propose that we can reduce the cost of looking up supplemental information that explains these micro-languages by automatically generating relevant explanations of this code on the fly.
