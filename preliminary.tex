\section{Preliminary Study}

How often do languages like regular expressions appear unexplained in online example code?
We use a case study of a sample of server configuration posts on StackOverflow to develop an intution for this question.
We turn to StackOverflow as, with over 9 million programmer questions, it is a large repository of shared programmer knowledge.\appachu{To develop an intuition of how unexplained snippets appear in online example code we turn to StackOverflow. With 9 million programmer questions, StackOverflow represents a large repository of shared programmer knowledge. We observe the use of unexplained regular expressions in posts about server configuration on StackOverflow as a case study.}

Using StackOverflow's Data Explorer, we scrape the top tags that co-occur with the tag \texttt{regex}, meaning regular expression.
We focus on tags names that correspond to higher-level goals or configuration tasks rather than language to understand what programming tasks can require regular expressions.
Our query yielded \appachu{tags corresponding to} 4 common tasks with more than 800 shared posts: .htaccess (Apache server configuration), mod-rewrite (more Apache server configuration), parsing, and validation.

Posts including both the \texttt{.htaccess} and \texttt{regex} tags together include more than 1 million view over all time, meaning these posts have reached a large audience, although it is but a fraction of the 7 million daily visits to the site.
Taking a sample of the 30 top most viewed StackOverflow questions with both the \texttt{.htaccess} and \texttt{regex} tags, we ask, what is percentage of postings that have regular expressions, and what percentage of these postings provide no explanation of the regular expression that appears whatsoever?
Excluding 2 posts that lacked any regular expressions, we found that 9 of the 28 posts (32\%) contained some mention of some part of the syntax.
Unexplained expressions ranged in complexity from short and generic --- \texttt{(.*)} --- to longer and specific --- \texttt{\^{}[A-Z]\{3,\}\textbackslash{}s(.*)/index\textbackslash{}.php}. 

We note that in 15 of these 28 questions, the original poster of the question or another user posted a comment to the accepted answer about errors encountered when working with the code or a request to modify the code in some way to a new purpose.
With this case study, we develop an intuition that the syntax of languages like regular expressions can go unexplained in online example code.
