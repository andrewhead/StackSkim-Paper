\section{Conclusion}

Programmers frequently turn to web to solve coding problems and find example code.
However, code snippets in programming help contain unexplained concepts that require them to seek additional help.
We propose language- and library- specific routines called \Glspl{name} that automatically generate \emph{on-demand, context-relevant} micro-explanations of code.
A \gls{name} for a language parses a code snippet and generates in-situ natural language explanations.
We demonstrate the technical effort required to build \glspl{name} by making explainers for CSS selectors, regular expressions, and command lines.
Through a preliminary in-lab study with beginner web programmers, we show that our automatically-generated explanations improves users' ability to modify example code containing CSS selectors.
