\section{Conclusion}

For programmers searching for technical solutions, modern search engines fail to support easy assessment of code-to-text ratio, common dependencies, and comparison of code examples.
In response, we present \systemname{}, a visual search tool to help programmers discover useful examples according to these tasks.
Our tool leverages three visual representations to help users find understandable programming solutions from search results.
First, we represent code example contents as color-coded stacked blocks of code and text.
Second, we rank classes and concepts by frequency and enable visual annotation of locations in the source text where these elements occur.
Third, we provide a snippets bank for users to store and compare a history of useful segments of code and text.
Through a 4-subject user study, we discovered that could more rapidly detect frequently used classes than with a baseline interface and that users believed the tool would be useful to explore code examples in unfamiliar topics.
In the future, we will explore how we can better encourage the breadth-first search procedures enabled by \systemname{} for users.
