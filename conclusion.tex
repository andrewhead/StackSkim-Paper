\section{Conclusions}

Programmers frequently turn to the web to solve coding problems and find example code.
However, code snippets within  help documentation can contain unexplained concepts that require programmers to seek additional help.
We propose language-specific routines called \glspl{name} that automatically generate \emph{on-demand, context-relevant} micro-explanations of code.
We demonstrate the technical effort required to build \glspl{name} by making \gls{exp} for CSS selectors, regular expressions, and terminal commands.
Through a preliminary in-lab study with programmers, we show that these automatically-generated explanations improve participants' ability to modify online code examples without referencing external documentation.
We believe that the \gls{name} ecosystem will make onine programming examples more understandable and resuable.
