Programmers frequently turn to the web to solve coding problems and find example code.
Useful sources of information include tutorials and online discussion forums such as StackOverflow.
However, these often include sample code that is too terse for programmers to understand without consulting additional resources.
We propose language- and library- specific routines called \Glspl{name} that automatically generate \emph{on-demand, context-relevant} explanations of code.
A \gls{name} for a language parses a code snippet and generates in-situ natural language explanations or usage examples.
We discuss design patterns for making context-relevant, widely-applicable explanations and usage examples, demonstrating these patterns by programming Tutorons for CSS selectors, regular expressions, and command lines. 
Through a preliminary in-lab study, we show that our automatically-generated explanations improve programmers' ability to modify example code containing CSS selectors and wget commands.
