When finding technical solutions, programmers select answers from search results with a variety of formats and approaches.
Modern search engines excel at providing relevant examples based on query terms and community rankings.
However, programmers benefit from considering multiple answers, discovering common solutions, and exploring examples in formats that fit their learning needs.
We present \systemname{}, a visual breadth-first search interface for rapid comparative exploration of examples that enables consideration of common classes and programming concepts across examples.
Through a 5-subject preliminary study, we find that users consider code-to-text ratio, dependency familiarity, and search history while finding solutions.
\systemname{} addresses these challenges by providing visual representations of code and text amounts, commonly used dependencies, and a snippets bank for comparing answers from StackOverflow.
Following a 4-subject user study, we show that \systemname{} enables users to detect common dependencies across many examples, albeit requiring an atypical search workflow.
